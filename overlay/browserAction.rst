browserAction
=============

The browserAction and :doc:`composeAction` APIs first appeared in Thunderbird 64.
They are very similar to Firefox's `browserAction API`__.

Many of our `sample extensions`__ use a browserAction.

  This API will be replaced in Manifest v3 by the `action API <https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest-mv3/action.html>`__.
