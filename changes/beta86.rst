Changes in Thunderbird 86
=========================

theme
=====

* The :ref:`theme_api` API was added to Thunderbird (see `bug 1684666 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1684666>`__). Itâ€™s more or less the same as the `Firefox theme API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/theme>`__, but has been extended to better fit the needs of Thunderbird.

  The color key ``sidebar_highlight_border`` has been added.

  *This change has been backported to Thunderbird 78.7.1.*
